# h2

The HTTP2 (h2) protocol frames library can be used to pack and encode HTTP2 frames into a byte buffer, as well as to unpack and decode HTTP2 frames from a byte buffer.

## Installation

Simply add h2 as a dependency to your lein project:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/h2/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/h2)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jg2356/h2.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jg2356/h2)

## Examples

The functions pack, buffer, frame and unpack can be used with a key-value map representing an unpacked frame.

- Only packed frames can be converted to a buffer.
- Frames obtained from a buffer are packed and should be unpacked to remove padding and special value fields from the payload.

For more examples see the collections of unit tests.

```clojure
(ns my-namespace
  (:require [h2.protocol.frame :refer :all]
            [h2.protocol.common :refer :all]))

; data frame example
(let [f {:type :data
         :stream 2
         :padding 66
         :flags #{:compressed :end-stream}
         :payload (b "this is a test")}]
  (-> f
      pack
      buffer
      frame
      unpack))
; returns: {:length 14, :type :data, :flags #{:end-stream :compressed}, :stream 2, :padding 66, :payload ...}
```
